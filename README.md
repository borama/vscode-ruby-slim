# Slim syntax highlighting for VS Code

The **Ruby Slim** extension brings [Slim template language](https://github.com/slim-template/slim) support to VS Code.
It fixes most issues in previous Slim extensions, aims to support more modern features such as
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and is well tested.

## Features

- A more complete [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) support, including:

  - [breakpoint prefixes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) in class shortcuts (`.sm:text-center`)

  - [modifiers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) in class shortcuts, even multiple ones (`.hover:dark:text-white`)

  - [opacity modifiers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color#changing-the-opacity) (`text-blue-600/50`)

- Developer goodies:
  - Full tests coverage
  - Grammar in a human-friendly format (YAMLÂ instead of JSON)

## Known Issues

- [Arbitrary values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values) in class shortcuts (`.top-[117px]`) are
  [not supported](https://github.com/slim-template/slim/issues/906) by Slim and this extension.
- [Embedded language blocks](https://github.com/slim-template/slim?tab=readme-ov-file#embedded-engines-markdown-) with inline attributes are not supported:

      scss class="myClass":
        ...
